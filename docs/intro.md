Hi, I'm **Media**!

I started my career as a technical writer in January 2023 and became the first Technical Writer at the company I currently work for. Previously, I have been working in the field of information technology for many years, starting from vocational high school and then as a junior programmer at the company where I officially worked for the first time. I have worked with Laravel, Vue, React, and Flutter.

As a technical writer, my responsibilities include communicating with the team to gather information needed for crafting documents. In addition, I am also responsible for managing the documentation, including maintenance and updates. I am used to using Static Site Generators (SSGs), so I am already skilled in working with Markdown and Git.

The documentation I have created is confidential, so the samples I present are just examples. Some of the types of documents I have created include:

- [**Technical Specification Document**](/docs/examples/tsd): This document details the technical specifications of a system or system component, including system architecture, detailed design, integration with other systems, and other technical specifications needed to implement the solution.
- [**API Documentation**](/docs/examples/api): API documentation is assisted by OpenAPI.
- [**Meeting of Minutes**](/blog/2023/01/01/mom): A summary of the meeting or minutes.
- **How To**: Some documentation that aims to assist users in performing an action, be it in the form of a Tutorial, Guideline, Manual Book, or User Guide.
- **Code Documentation**: Explains how the code works, and the purpose of certain parts of the code.
- [**Diagrams**](docs/examples/diagram): To support the audience's understanding of the document, diagrams are created as a visualization aid. Among the tools used are draw.io, mermaid, and Lucidchart.

In addition, I am also used to using various tools for communication and documentation, such as Canva, Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Docs, Slack, and Trello.
